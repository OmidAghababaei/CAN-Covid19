<h1>About</h1>
<p><strong>Time of last data update:</strong> 2020-04-18 20:00 EDT</p>
<p><strong><em>News!</em></strong> I am excited to share with everyone, <a href="https://twitter.com/rose_carrot">Rose Garrett</a>, will be joining me to improve this dashboard. Rose is a second year PhD student in Biostatistics at DLSPH, University of Toronto, also under the supervision of <a href="https://twitter.com/EMPullenayegum">Dr. Eleanor Pullenayegum</a> at Sickkids. Rose will create new visualization figures for us. Stay tuned!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your interest in our COVID-19 data visualization project.</strong> There are many great COVID-19 Canada dashboards available online. We have compiled the following list to show some of the dashboards that inspired us to build this one.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://art-bd.shinyapps.io/covid19canada/">The COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Groups dashboard</a> developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/JPSoucy">Jean-Paul R. Soucy</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ishaberry2">Isha Berry</a>, two amazing talented students from DLSPH.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/RamiKrispin/italy_dash">The Covid19 Italy dashboard</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/Rami_Krispin">Rami Krispin</a>. Rami’s Covid19 Italy dashboard was also the coding template used in creating this dashboard.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://resources-covid19canada.hub.arcgis.com/">The Esri Canada COVID-19 Canada dashboard</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/2f1a13ca0b29422f9b34660f0b705043/">The PHAC COVID-19 Canada dashboard</a>, <strong>most accurate and reliable</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://howsmyflattening.ca/#/analysis">The Ontario-specific COVID-19 Analysis Website</a> which covers detailed Ontario focused COVID-19 information.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.inspq.qc.ca/covid-19/donnees">The Québec provincial COVID-19 dashboard</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://covid19stats.alberta.ca/">The Alberta provincial COVID-19 dashboard</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Last but not least, I want to give a shout-out to <a href="https://twitter.com/suivicovid">Marc-Olivier Hétu</a> whom I met on Twitter. He has been scraping public COVID-19 Canada data since March and compiled an outstanding spreadsheet with graphic analysis, which he generiously shared with me. I have adopted one of Marc’s special figure on this dash and named it the Marc-Olivier figure.</p>

<li><strong>Data</strong>
<ul>
<li>Canada data used in this dashboard are extracted from the data posted by the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group (<a href="https://github.com/ishaberry/Covid19Canada" class="uri">https://github.com/ishaberry/Covid19Canada</a>) lead by <a href="https://twitter.com/JPSoucy">Jean-Paul R. Soucy</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ishaberry2">Isha Berry</a>. Since April 1st, the working group collected and reported case and mortality data directly from Public Health Units. Thus, the case and mortality numbers reported may be higher than those from other sources, incuding the Ontario Ministry of Health. We direct readers to their dashboard website, <a href="https://art-bd.shinyapps.io/covid19canada/">About the data section</a> for details.
<ul>
<li><strong>We want to express our sincere appreciation to all contributors of the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group.</strong> <strong>Here is a list of contributors we want to pay special tribute to <a href="https://twitter.com/ishaberry2">Isha Berry</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JPSoucy">Jean-Paul R.

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dashboard R code</strong>
<ul>
<li>I built this dashboard using <strong>Rami Krispin’s Covid19 Italy <a href="https://github.com/RamiKrispin/italy_dash">dashboard</a>’s code</strong> as template. Rami’s code can be found on his <a href="https://github.com/RamiKrispin/covid19Italy">github page</a>.</li>
